The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: "1"
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "1211"

其实就是通过上一个字符串（数组）生成下一个字符串（数组）

生成方法：
每次都数出连续的相同值的个数。将个数和值加入新数组
