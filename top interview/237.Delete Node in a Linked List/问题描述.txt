Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
Example 2:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
Note:

The linked list will have at least two elements.
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
Do not return anything from your function.

删除当前的节点，第一个想法是将前一节点的next指向当前节点的next。但是我们并不能得到前一个节点，但是我们可以将下一个节点copy到当前节点，这样删除下一个节点的同时保留了下一个节点。
