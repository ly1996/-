Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Note:

You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

思路：
数在1-n之间，那么我们可以将每个数放到其该在的位置上，然后将其标志为占有，当下一个相同的数出现时，就会发现位置已经被占有，然后被发现。
