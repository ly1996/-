Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5

构造高度平衡的二叉树，最简单的方法就是让左右子树的节点数的差<=1.
所以我们每次都将数组平分，然后用左右数组构造中间节点的左右子树。
