Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

乘积长度由1到总长度
计算的规律如下：
2	3	-2	4
	6	-6	-8
		-12	-24
			-48
所以最大值为6
