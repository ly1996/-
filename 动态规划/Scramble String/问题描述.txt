Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":

    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".

    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t
We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".

    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a
We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".

Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
Output: false

字符串a和字符串b如果是scramble的，那么一定可以把a和b分成两段:a的前一段和b的前一段scramble，a的后一段段和b的后一段scramble或者a的前一段和b的后一段scramble，a的后一段段和b的前一段scramble。
如果字符串长度为1，只需要比对是否相等（终止条件）
