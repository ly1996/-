You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
Example 2:

Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

用minCounts数组来代表每个数I的最小count
其实对于数i，我们只需要遍历所有硬币，如果该硬币面值<=i，那么可以得到一个minCounts[i-coin]+1，我们比较每个可能的coin，得到最小值。
